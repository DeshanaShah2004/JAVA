/*1. Inheritance â€“ Medium

Question:
Create a Java program where you have a base class Vehicle with properties brand and speed.

The class should have a method displayInfo() that prints brand and speed.

Derive a class Car that adds a property seats and overrides the displayInfo() method to also print the number of seats.

Write a main method to create a Car object and display its details.*/

// Base class
class Vehicle {
    String brand;
    int speed;

    // Constructor
    Vehicle(String brand, int speed) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.speed = speed;
    }

    // Method to display vehicle information
    void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Brand: " + brand);
        System.out.println("Speed: " + speed + " km/h");
    }
}

// Derived class
class Car extends Vehicle {
    int seats;

    // Constructor
    Car(String brand, int speed, int seats) {
        super(brand, speed); // call parent constructor
        this.seats = seats;
    }

    // Overriding displayInfo()
    @Override
    void displayInfo() {
        super.displayInfo(); // call parent method
        System.out.println("Seats: " + seats);
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", 180, 5);
        myCar.displayInfo();
    }
}
